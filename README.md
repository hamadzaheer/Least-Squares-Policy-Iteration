# Least-Squares-Policy-Iteration
Implementation of Experimental Results from Least-Squares Policy Iteration paper by Michail G. Lagoudakis and Ronald Parr

# Model-Based Policy Iteration:
A model of the system is used to find the optimal policy and the corresponding optimal value function.

Pseudo Code for implementing Model-Based PI algorithm for the Chain Walk problem.

Inputs:

The reward of going from state s_prev to state s, R(s):

$R_{cwp}=\left[ 0 \quad 0 \quad 0 \quad 1 \quad 1 \quad 0 \quad 0 \quad 0 \right]^{\rm T}$

for i=1:n
