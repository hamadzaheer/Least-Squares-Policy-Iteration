# Least-Squares-Policy-Iteration
Implementation of Experimental Results from Least-Squares Policy Iteration paper by Michail G. Lagoudakis and Ronald Parr

Model-Based Policy Iteration: A model of the system is used to find the optimal policy and the corresponding optimal value function.
Pseudo Code for implementing Model-Based PI algorithm for the Chain Walk problem.
Inputs:
The reward of going from state s_prev to state s, R(s):
$R_{cwp}=[0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0]^{\rm T}$
